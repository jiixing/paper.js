----


can't really combine brunch.require with whatever abomination the paper js is doing

replacing include with require need to import the global and export the class that is being defined
  in each source file.

  as currently all include(file) call is in the same scope

the <script for the html file

acorn  to allow es6 in paperscript
../src/load.js  allow debugging each paper.js source file separately

babel-polyfill  allow writing async await in the app file
