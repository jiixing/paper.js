setting style will go to _style[set](value directly to the children, style.js line 146


    Base.each(groupDefaults, function(value, key) {
        var isColor = /Color$/.test(key),
            isPoint = key === 'shadowOffset',
            part = Base.capitalize(key),
            flag = flags[key],
            set = 'set' + part,
            get = 'get' + part;

        // Define getters and setters to be injected into this class.
        // This is how style values are handled:
        // - Style values are all stored in this._values
        // - The style object starts with an empty _values object, with fallback
        //   on _defaults through code in the getter below.
        // - Only the styles that are explicitly set on the object get defined
        //   in _values.
        // - Color values are not stored as converted colors immediately. The
        //   raw value is stored, and conversion only happens in the getter.
        fields[set] = function(value) {
            var owner = this._owner,
                children = owner && owner._children,
                applyToChildren = children && children.length > 0
                    && !(owner instanceof CompoundPath);
            // Only unify styles on children of Groups, excluding CompoundPaths.
            if (applyToChildren) {
                for (var i = 0, l = children.length; i < l; i++)
                    children[i]._style[set](value);
            }
            // Always store selectedColor in item _values to make sure that


this._style.fillColor

this acutally call the getFillColor as defined in fields[get] and for group it gets it from the children
  so when you remove children all the style is gone

  when you set it is passed directly via
  fields[set]  in style.js
